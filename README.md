## List of scripts 

#### StackExchange link newtaber

I needed to open links from posts and answers in the new tab instead of annoying in-place opening without `<Ctrl>` button or anything else just in ordinary way. 

Because I did not find any sufficient solution of my problem I wrote own userscript which do what I want. If you have same issue you can install it from my repo:  
[StackExchange link newtaber](https://github.com/almaceleste/userscripts/raw/master/StackExchange_link_newtaber.user.js)  

* This script should work in all StackExchange sites.  
* Use settings to choose which links will be affected. 

#### Gnome Extensions tweaks
This script opens the extension pages in the new tab and and changes default sorting of the extensions list on the `Extensions` nav button
